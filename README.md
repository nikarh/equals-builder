What is EqualsBuilder?
-----------------------

Compare objects in Java using the following DSL:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return EqualsBuilder.test(this, o)
            .comparing(Human::getName)
            .comparing(Human::getSurname)
            .comparing(Human::getAge)
            .areEqual();
}
```

Motivation
----------

In Java there are three methods inherited from `Object` class that are often overloaded:

- `java boolean equals(Object o)`
- `int hashCode()`
- `String toString()`

The most simple implementation for `toString`, generated by an IDE might look as follows:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Address{" +
            "house=" + house +
            ", street='" + street + '\'' +
            ", city='" + city + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```

This code is not exactly what is considered 'pretty' by most developers.
A more appealing implementation, using a helper from [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) 
would look like:

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this)
            .add("house", house)
            .add("street", street)
            .add("city", city)
            .toString();
}
```

With a better readability and maintainability, it is usually
favored by the developers more.

For a `.hashCode()` method overloads in Java 7 an `Objects.hash(Object...)` method was introduced, 
which allowed developers to write the following code:

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(house, street, city);
}
```

At the same time `Objects.equals(a, b)` was also introduced, making .equals overloads somewhat more readable.

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    Address that = (Address) o;
    return Objects.equals(house, that.house) &&
            Objects.equals(street, that.street) &&
            Objects.equals(city, that.city);
}
```

Still, this implementation has some nasty boilerplate code like
null checks, type checks, and type casts.

As an alternative one might consider using `EqualsBuilder` class from [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/)
library:

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) { return false; }
    if (o == this) { return true; }
    if (o.getClass() != getClass()) {
        return false;
    }
    Address rhs = (Address) o;
    return new EqualsBuilder()
            .appendSuper(super.equals(o))
            .append(house, rhs.house)
            .append(street, rhs.street)
            .append(city, rhs.city)
            .isEquals();
}
```

Unfortunately, not only does this implementation not help with casts and type checks,
but it also takes more space on your screen and attempts to fix English language
by introducing a method named "isEquals".

To compliment already existing helpers for overloading `.hashCode` and `.toString`,
an attempt was made to create a DSL for comparing two Java objects.

Goals
-----

The goals for this project are:

- Make a simple yet good DSL for comparing objects by different fields
- Reduce boilerplate code required to use this DSL to zero
- Reduce text repetition (`.append(street, other.street)` might look like `.append(street)`)
- Make it comparable to a naive implementation generated by an IDE performance-wise
