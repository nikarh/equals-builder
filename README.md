equals-builder: fluent builder API for you .equals() methods
============================================================

What is equals-builder?
-----------------------
Compare objects in Java using the fillowing DSL:
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    return EqualsBuilder.test(this, o)
            .comparing(Human::getName)
            .comparing(Human::getSurname)
            .comparing(Human::getAge)
            .areEqual();
}
```

Motivation
----------

In Java there are three methods inhertied from Object class which are often overloaded:
- `java boolean equals(Object o)`
- `int hashCode()`
- `String toString()`

A naive implementation of toString, generated by IDE might look as follows:
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Address{" +
            "id=" + id +
            ", name='" + name + '\'' +
            ", address='" + address + '\'' +
            '}';
}
```
This is not exactly what is considered 'pretty' by most developers.
More appealing implementation, such as the one that can be found in [guava](https://github.com/google/guava) 
would look like:
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this)
            .add("id", id)
            .add("name", name)
            .add("address", address)
            .toString();
}
```
Having better readability and being easier to maintain, it is usually
favored more by developers.

For `.hashCode()` overloads in Java 7 `Objects.hash` method was introduced, 
allowing developersto write the following code:
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(id, name, address);
}
```

In Java 7 `Objects.equals(a, b)` was also introduced which 
made .equals overloads somewhat more readable.
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    Address that = (Address) o;
    return Objects.equals(id, that.id) &&
            Objects.equals(name, that.name) &&
            Objects.equals(address, that.address);
}
```

Still, this implementation has boilerplate, that will be included
in all `.equals` methods that are going to be overloaded, like
null checks, type checks and type casts.

There is also a EqualsBuilder class included in [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/)
with which you can write
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) { return false; }
    if (o == this) { return true; }
    if (o.getClass() != getClass()) {
        return false;
    }
    Address rhs = (Address) o;
    return new EqualsBuilder()
            .appendSuper(super.equals(o))
            .append(id, rhs.id)
            .append(name, rhs.name)
            .append(address, rhs.address)
            .isEquals();
}
```
Unfortunately, not only does this implementation not help with casts and type checks,
it also takes more space on your screen an attempts to fix english language
by introducing method named "isEquals".

To compliment good helper methods for overloading `.hashCode` and `.toString` methods
an attempt was made to create a DSL for comparing two Java objects.

Goals
-----
The goals for this project are simple:
- Make simple yet good DSL for comparing objects by multiple fields
- Reduce boilerplate required to use this DSL to zero
- Reduce field repetition (`.append(name, other.name)` to `.append(name)`)
- Make it performance-wise comparable to naive implementation generated by IDE
